#IsItOn
**A website and chrome plugin to help find music that's on YouTube on rdio and Spotify**

##What am I looking here?

Everything outside of the "plugin" folder is the Flask app, which powers the website. Inside the "plugin" folder is, well, the Chrome plugin. 

##Couldn't I just search songs manually?

Yeah, you could, and it might be more accurate too. But if someone links you a youtube video, it might save you a couple seconds of copying and pasting.

##â€¦it gave me a link to something totally unrelated

That happens sometimes, depending on the title of the youtube video. I've found that for fairly standard titles, Spotify is almost always correct, but rdio has a better chance of finding something titled strangely. When in doubt, you can always search manually.
